                    <h4> Online Voting System</h4>
                    <p> Online voting is an electronic way of choosing leaders via a web driven application. The
                        advantage of online voting over the common “queue method” is that the voters have the choice of
                        voting at their own free time and there is reduced congestion. It also minimizes on errors of
                        vote counting. The individual votes are submitted in a database which can be queried to find out
                        who of the aspirants for a given post has the highest number of votes. </p>
                    <p>This Website Project Made in PBL project during 2nd year of engineering and In this project, the
                        concept of developing an electronic voting system using PHP AND MYSQL is implemented. Voting Process is  simple
                    any user can come and vote in very less time and a Person only Vote one Time.</p>
